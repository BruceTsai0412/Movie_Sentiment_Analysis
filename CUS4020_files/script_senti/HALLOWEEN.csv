AARON,Character,"Testing, testing. One, two, three. Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the security desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. The nurse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song from a 1930's musical plays. Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard, KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it, discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature. He glances through the glass at his visitors. Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS through warped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to reality as a ward activates the door lock.
